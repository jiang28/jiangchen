Hi! I am Chen Jiang, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/comp/#gsc.tab=0) at [Auburn University](https://eng.auburn.edu/).

Research Interests
======
My research interests include data mining, spatio-temporal modeling, and AI for Science (AI4Science). I focus on leveraging artificial intelligence and big data analytics to address challenges in economic forecasting, agricultural yield prediction, and climate modeling.

Background
======
I am completing my PhD in Computer Science at Auburn University, where I am supervised by [Dr. Ku Wei-Shinn](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/~weishinn/). I was originally from China. I completed my B.Ac. at [Hanover College](https://www.hanover.edu/) with a major in Computer Science and a minor in History, and my M.Sc. at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html).
